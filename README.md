# Run-NOW

Run-NOW is a tool to predict the ground surface conditions before going for a run.

Generally, we check the temperature and rainfall before starting a run.
But ground waterlogging due to rainfall a few hours before can lead to a unsatisfactory run.

So this tool uses observed rainfall data to predict if the ground conditions are ideal for a run.
